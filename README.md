# meye-bot
This is a telegram bot that is able to send messages when [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) detects motion.

I am using this as a small security camera feature where it is able to update me (and possibly my roommate) in case one of us are not at home and the camera detects motion.

It uses the [**python-telegram-bot**](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) wrapper for the Telegram API.
